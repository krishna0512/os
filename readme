This is the official readme file for my first Operating System.
it will be expanded further soon..

steps to compile the os after pulling it from git.

-->	type "make"
-->	type "bochs"

for running this os you should have bochs installed you can do that in ubnutu by typing
	"sudo apt-get install bochs"
also a bochs-sdl plugin is required which could be downloaded from ubuntu software center.
