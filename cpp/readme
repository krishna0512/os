Steps to execute this Hello World Operating System.

First of all make sure that you have the following tools installed on your System.

--> g++		(for compiling the c++ header files)
--> nasm	(Netwide Assembler for compiling the assembly language part of it)
--> bochs	(for the execution of the OS)

Note: It is not recommended to use qemu as this OS is still not tested in qemu.

If you are using fedora then Simply type the following.
	$> make
	$> bochs
bochs may give the options of loading the bochsrc.txt file 
If it prompts for a input then type 6 and press Enter.


else If you are using ubuntu then there is a little extra work that
you have to do (sorry cannot avoid this it is a bug in ubuntu Blame them).

Since Bochs cannot use X Windows system as the display_library I have to
change the display library to SDL.
but you need to install the sdl library. For that Go to Ubuntu Software Center 
and search for a package called bochs-sdl. go ahead install it.
And then type the follwing commands in terminal.
	$> make
	$> bochs


The bochs will open up a grub screen which will have some intro messages and then a 
prompt stating

grub>_

type "kernel 200+21" (without quotes) and press enter.
It should give a one line message and again prompt for more input

type "boot" (without quotes) and press enter.

Hurray the operating System should boot by now.




Thats it for now,
will keep updating this readme for more insights of this OS.

Regards,
Krishna
