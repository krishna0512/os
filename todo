->	add the pointer reference to putc function in monitor.cpp so that it is able to handle the function syntax line.
	video v;
	v.putc('A').putc('B').putc('C');
	that is it can link various call together.
	and if possible also add this line.
	v.putc('A').write("Continued..").putc('A');
	
->	go ahead with GDT and IVT tutorial.

->	the write portion of the function which handles the integer is really slow and not optimised at all.
	find a better solution to it by either using arrays or otherwise.

->	implement the new, new[], delete, delete[] operators so that we can access the array

->	finish the implemantation of string class.
	and also integrate this class with other classes like video class.
